# StudyDump
There is nothing useful here, it's hust me messing around.<br/>
Listen I know I started 3 repos in like 1 month, but I just want repo to dump all my practise stuff and to color the activity squares<br/>
## What is this repo?
Basically this is my training repository. I'm gonna dump here everything I do during the 100DaysOfCode challenge, that is not my projects. ~~Plus this readme can be something like a daily log, right?~~<br/>
I used to have a journal here, but since it was getting to long to my comfort, I moved it to seperate file.<br/>
Feel free to poke around and make fun of my terrible code. Here is some info about the projects in the folders of this repo.
## ConsoleTraining
This is the first part of my journey. I realized that I forgot most of the things we did at my university programming class, so I followed freecodecamp.org youtube video tutorial. This is just a part of it though. However I was able to make standalone app of it later.
## ConsoleTrainingPT2
The rest of the freecodecamp tutorial. Mainly classes and getters/setters and stuff.
## DataBindingStudy
Just messing around with data binding with Xaml and WPF.
## Dummy_JustToDoIt
Clone of my JustToDoIt repo. I wanted to make some changes, but at the same time, didn't want to completely destroy the progress I made in original repo. <br/>
I'll delete this soon and make it a fork of JustToDoIt repo or something.
## WPF_HelloWorld
Hello world app in WPF. Used to learn the complete basics of Xaml.
## LearningLayouts
Continuation of the WPF_HelloWorld app, though this is just layouts, that wouldn't fit to main window it the project.
