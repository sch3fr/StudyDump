# StudyDump
Listen I know I started 3 repos in like 1 month, but I just want repo to dump all my practise stuff and to color the activity squares

## What is this repo?
Basically this is my training repository. I'm gonna dump here everything I do during the 100DaysOfCode challenge, that is not my projects. Plus this readme can be something like a daily log, right?
## 15.7.21
I started this repo because I was working on Just-To-DoIt, but then I realized that I'm kinda lost and that I need to return to basics and fully understand the core concepts. Kinda wish I wasn't slacking so much during my programming basics course at uni.
