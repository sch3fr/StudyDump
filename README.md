# StudyDump
Listen I know I started 3 repos in like 1 month, but I just want repo to dump all my practise stuff and to color the activity squares

## What is this repo?
Basically this is my training repository. I'm gonna dump here everything I do during the 100DaysOfCode challenge, that is not my projects. Plus this readme can be something like a daily log, right?

I started this repo because I was working on Just-To-DoIt, but then I realized that I'm kinda lost and that I need to return to basics and fully understand the core concepts. Kinda wish I wasn't slacking so much during my programming basics course at uni.

I did some more of the C# revision with freeCodeCamp C# crash course. Even though I revised for as long as yesterday it feels like the time was much shorter. Tommorow I'm doing some theory stuff, I really need to clear those things up in those areas. I should finish the course tommorow and then I'll have to find something else to do. Either the course or just some project, we'll see.
## 17.7.21
I finally finished the C# course. It really helped me with understanding concepts like classes and stuf. Honestly the video course was better then whole semester of 'Introduction to OOP'.
