# StudyDump
There is nothing useful here, it's hust me messing around.

Listen I know I started 3 repos in like 1 month, but I just want repo to dump all my practise stuff and to color the activity squares

## What is this repo?
Basically this is my training repository. I'm gonna dump here everything I do during the 100DaysOfCode challenge, that is not my projects. Plus this readme can be something like a daily log, right?
## 15-JUL-21
I started this repo because I was working on Just-To-DoIt, but then I realized that I'm kinda lost and that I need to return to basics and fully understand the core concepts. Kinda wish I wasn't slacking so much during my programming basics course at uni.
## 16-JUL-21
I did some more of the C# revision with freeCodeCamp C# crash course. Even though I revised for as long as yesterday it feels like the time was much shorter. Tommorow I'm doing some theory stuff, I really need to clear those things up in those areas. I should finish the course tommorow and then I'll have to find something else to do. Either the course or just some project, we'll see.
## 17-JUL-21
I finally finished the C# course. It really helped me with understanding concepts like classes and stuf. Honestly the video course was better then whole semester of 'Introduction to OOP'.
## 18-JUL-21
Today I finally scratched the surface of WPM with actual study materials. No random messing around anymore, just reading the documentation and following the guidance of another C# course, this time focused on the WPF. I hope I'll be able to understand XAML soon, so I can get to Xamarin ASAP.
## 19-JUL-21
Although I found it really difficult to focus today, I still did quite a lot, I think. Looking up someone explaining the connections between .xaml and .xaml.cs files is tremendously helpful.
## 20-JUL-21
I did some UI tweaks and learned about new thing is WPF. Today is the 8th day of the challenge (I started this log on the 3rd day) and I really hope I can bring myself to really code everyday. While I like coding, it was really hard for me to force myself to actually do it today and yesterday. Here's to better tommorow.
## 21-JUL-21
Finally I got to learning the XAML layouts. I'm so excited!
## 22-JUL-21
I dinished the WPF course today, so I went ahead and edid the Just(To)DoIt UI with the knowledge I gained. Now it looks much better and it stays good looking even when resizing the window! I'm doing the logic behind it tommorow, which is kinda scary since my skills are shaky there.
## 23-JUL-21
Couldn't do my coding the first thing in the morning as always, so I had to wait untill the afternoon to be able to write some code. Unfortunately I found out that I'm not as well equiped for xaml app as I thought I was. I'm stuck and I can't seem to resolve it. It's kinda demotivating, ngl.
### EDIT
I managed to fix one of the problems, so while I'm not confident in my skills, I still feel better about everything than before.
## 24-JUL-21
Not much done today. I am stuck again. I did some tweaks and removed some useless pieces of code, but in terms of the logic behind my Just(To)DoIt app not much has been done today.
## 25-JUL-21
Trying to wrap my head around data binding. It could make my project so much easier. I spent most of yesterday's session trying to (unsuccessfully) google all the errors, now I know I can just use different approach.
## 26-JUL-21
I think I need to look up some more info about WPF, since I am still confused about lots of things. Hopefuly I'll get unstuck soon.
## 27-JUL-21
It was hard to actually bring myself to code today, but I'm glad I did. I like to keep the streak going.
## 28-JUL-21
Hangover update, finished Currency UI. Looking forward to exploring the logic behind it.
## 29-JUL-21
I was feeling kinda sick today, really didn't want to code, but I also don't want to lose the streak, so I did open an IDE and made some changes to the current project.
## 30-JUL-21
No real updates today, just spent a lot of time messing ith xaml, hopefuly I'll be able to use what I learned todsay in Just(To)DoIt.
## 31-JUL-21
I feel so dumb for not reading the official documentation. Makes my life so much easier.
## 1-AUG-21
I don't know what was I doning wrong yesterday, but today I changed 1 single line of code and the TBD dummy project works as intended!. Sure there are some improvements I'd have to do if I wanted to release it or something, BUT the minimum viable product is there! Now I need to implement it to Just(To)DoIt!
## 2-AUG-21
Seems like my work yesterday is paying of. While not everything is working yet, it did help me a lot to understand some of the things. What makes me especially happy is that most of my compiler issues are not caused by bad logic, but by forgetting ';' and '}'.
## 3-AUG-21
Usualy I like to do my programming the first thing in the morning, but today I was busy with family stuff so I'm programming in the evening. It is kinda weird, I'm tired. I did have a coffee, but I feel like I'm just tired FASTER. Anyway I tried to do some more things with JustToDoIt. yeah.
### EDIT
It works. I'm so proud of myself, it is finally working. There are so many things to tweak and make better, but the core of it is working. I'm so happy.
## 4-AUG-21
Kinda struggling to find what to code today. Other than that i cleaned up this repo...
## 5-AUG-21
Even though my morning was hellish today, I stil brought myself to code a little and I implemented and then fixed saving fetaure in the Just(To)DoIt app!
Feelin' good about myself.
## 6-AUG-21
Today I'm trying to add a feature to the todo app, but it ain't working so far. Not every Sunday can be Easter eh?
