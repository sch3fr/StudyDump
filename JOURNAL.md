# Journal
This is a journal of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. I decided to write it here, since I don't want to spam my twitter profile with these updates.<br/>
I started writing a few days after I started the challenge, so this will have less than 100 entries.
## 15-JUL-21
I started this repo because I was working on Just-To-DoIt, but then I realized that I'm kinda lost and that I need to return to basics and fully understand the core concepts. Kinda wish I wasn't slacking so much during my programming basics course at uni.
## 16-JUL-21
I did some more of the C# revision with freeCodeCamp C# crash course. Even though I revised for as long as yesterday it feels like the time was much shorter. Tommorow I'm doing some theory stuff, I really need to clear those things up in those areas. I should finish the course tommorow and then I'll have to find something else to do. Either the course or just some project, we'll see.
## 17-JUL-21
I finally finished the C# course. It really helped me with understanding concepts like classes and stuf. Honestly the video course was better then whole semester of 'Introduction to OOP'.
## 18-JUL-21
Today I finally scratched the surface of WPM with actual study materials. No random messing around anymore, just reading the documentation and following the guidance of another C# course, this time focused on the WPF. I hope I'll be able to understand XAML soon, so I can get to Xamarin ASAP.
## 19-JUL-21
Although I found it really difficult to focus today, I still did quite a lot, I think. Looking up someone explaining the connections between .xaml and .xaml.cs files is tremendously helpful.
## 20-JUL-21
I did some UI tweaks and learned about new thing is WPF. Today is the 8th day of the challenge (I started this log on the 3rd day) and I really hope I can bring myself to really code everyday. While I like coding, it was really hard for me to force myself to actually do it today and yesterday. Here's to better tommorow.
## 21-JUL-21
Finally I got to learning the XAML layouts. I'm so excited!
## 22-JUL-21
I dinished the WPF course today, so I went ahead and edid the Just(To)DoIt UI with the knowledge I gained. Now it looks much better and it stays good looking even when resizing the window! I'm doing the logic behind it tommorow, which is kinda scary since my skills are shaky there.
## 23-JUL-21
Couldn't do my coding the first thing in the morning as always, so I had to wait untill the afternoon to be able to write some code. Unfortunately I found out that I'm not as well equiped for xaml app as I thought I was. I'm stuck and I can't seem to resolve it. It's kinda demotivating, ngl.
### EDIT
I managed to fix one of the problems, so while I'm not confident in my skills, I still feel better about everything than before.
## 24-JUL-21
Not much done today. I am stuck again. I did some tweaks and removed some useless pieces of code, but in terms of the logic behind my Just(To)DoIt app not much has been done today.
## 25-JUL-21
Trying to wrap my head around data binding. It could make my project so much easier. I spent most of yesterday's session trying to (unsuccessfully) google all the errors, now I know I can just use different approach.
## 26-JUL-21
I think I need to look up some more info about WPF, since I am still confused about lots of things. Hopefuly I'll get unstuck soon.
## 27-JUL-21
It was hard to actually bring myself to code today, but I'm glad I did. I like to keep the streak going.
## 28-JUL-21
Hangover update, finished Currency UI. Looking forward to exploring the logic behind it.
## 29-JUL-21
I was feeling kinda sick today, really didn't want to code, but I also don't want to lose the streak, so I did open an IDE and made some changes to the current project.
## 30-JUL-21
No real updates today, just spent a lot of time messing ith xaml, hopefuly I'll be able to use what I learned todsay in Just(To)DoIt.
## 31-JUL-21
I feel so dumb for not reading the official documentation. Makes my life so much easier.
## 1-AUG-21
I don't know what was I doning wrong yesterday, but today I changed 1 single line of code and the TBD dummy project works as intended!. Sure there are some improvements I'd have to do if I wanted to release it or something, BUT the minimum viable product is there! Now I need to implement it to Just(To)DoIt!
## 2-AUG-21
Seems like my work yesterday is paying of. While not everything is working yet, it did help me a lot to understand some of the things. What makes me especially happy is that most of my compiler issues are not caused by bad logic, but by forgetting ';' and '}'.
## 3-AUG-21
Usualy I like to do my programming the first thing in the morning, but today I was busy with family stuff so I'm programming in the evening. It is kinda weird, I'm tired. I did have a coffee, but I feel like I'm just tired FASTER. Anyway I tried to do some more things with JustToDoIt. yeah.
### EDIT
It works. I'm so proud of myself, it is finally working. There are so many things to tweak and make better, but the core of it is working. I'm so happy.
## 4-AUG-21
Kinda struggling to find what to code today. Other than that i cleaned up this repo...
## 5-AUG-21
Even though my morning was hellish today, I stil brought myself to code a little and I implemented and then fixed saving fetaure in the Just(To)DoIt app!
Feelin' good about myself.
## 6-AUG-21
Today I'm trying to add a feature to the todo app, but it ain't working so far. Not every Sunday can be Easter eh?
## 7-AUG-21
Another day of struggle. I'm trying to change the task of my JTDI app from string to its own class with the name string and finished bool. But when I do that, my saving solution is not working and it messes up the list view. I'm not pushing todays and yesterdays updates, since it is not working yet, and there is a somewhat working version on my JTDI repo right now.
## 8-AUG-21
It is much easier to code when i actually have a plan, or something exact to work on. That being said, changing the JTDI tasks from string to class is major pain in the butt.</br>
Anyway I did some research today about Xamarin and MAUI and I came to a conclusion that waiting for new technology is pointless, so I can hop on the Hungie train whenever I feel like it. That being said I don't feel like it today.
## 9-AUG-21
It was really hard for me to bring myself to do something. I really don't feel like working on the JTDI at the moment. I still want to finish it, but today, I felt more like reviving Hungie and cleaning the repo. I know I messed something up last time I poked around, but I had no idea what most of the files were. Anyway I deleted everything there and started new project. I ca understand the XAML just fine now. It shiuldn't be that bad.
## 10-AUG-21
I feel like I don't understand classes well enough, so today is mostly research day. Also I'm having some troubles with commiting to git. Can't figure out what's going on yet.
### EDIT
github is having problems, so I don't have to troubleshoot anything on my side :)
## 11-AUG-21
After whole day of watching the Twin Peaks I decided to change things a bit in the console training project. It's not done, but I was having fun today :)
## 12-AUG-21
It's been too long since the last time I had a nice coding session in the morning. I should get back into the habbit of coding first thing in the morning. Anyway today I'm playing with console again.
## 13-AUG-21
I tried handling expectaition in the CT1. I found a simple yet elegant solution for one of the problems I faced today. The best kind of solutions.
## 14-AUG-21
Started a new xamarin project in this repo. Just to get myself comfortable with xamarin. We'll see how it goes.
## 15-AUG-21
Today I found great Xamarin explanation youtube series. I'm really stoked that after an hour I'm much more familiar with xamarin forms than I've been ever since I started poking around with it in June.
## 16-AUG-21
Another day of following tutorials. Hope to finish 'em soon so I can understand Xamarin.forms better and start developing my first android app!
## 17-AUG-21
Finally started learning about MVVM, after hearing about it so much in everything related to android app development.
## 18-AUG-21
I'm so dumb I added a dot to a namespace thinking it would be like a version idicator, but in doing so I managed to destroy my whole namespace and solution structure. Congratulations, I played myself.
## 19-AUG-21
Kinda getting lost with the tutorial I liked so much before. Dude skipped ahead so much I have no Idea what's going on.
## 20-AUG-21
Geting back to JTDI, though I made no progress so far.
## 21-AUG-21
feeling like smashing my head against the wall. absolutely no progress. Stuck on all fronts :(
## 22-AUG-21
I think I understand all of the things I learned in my Programming 101 class well, however there are so many things I still don't understand that I think are important. Like using classes, constructors, we barely touched methods, debugging etc. So studying this is on the menu today and the next few days.
## 23-AUG-21
Didn't get to code untill late in the evening. I didn't feel like much so I started a new project - physic calculator. It's more of a joke than a serious project, but it'd be nice to do it.
## 24-AUG-21
Life happens, however I was able to write a few lines of code tonight.
## 25-AUG-21
Todays progress, even if not much, feels great. However, the physics calulator is much more complex project than I anticipated. I'm reaching the treshold of it becoming a large pile of spaghetti code. I might need to restructuralize it sooner than later.
## 26-AUG-21
I changed the prjext structure, thoug I still feel like I'm over engineering things. Anyway what's important is that I'm really having a blast building this calculator.
## 27-AUG-21
Can't figure out one do-while loop *insert thonking emoji here*. Other than that I have to do some manual, not really interesting things before I can move onto something more fun, but I can't bring myself to do it fast. I know exactly what I have to do, but it's not even remotely as exciting as figuring othesr stuff out.
Once I'll start building UI for my calculator, I might try WinUI.
## 28-AUG-21
I feel so dumb for yesterday. The mistake I made in the loop yesterday was using '||' instead of '&&'.<br/>Anyway, I feel super tired today, maybe kinda sick. I think I have a new approach for the calculator. Instead of making special function for every type of problem, I'll make fewver functions, so I can repurpose code of problems with similar solutions, for examle when the solution is a=b*c, then I can jast pass the numbers. However there is some case specific test that I have to take care of, and right now I feel too drowsy to figure it out.
## 29-AUG-21
I'm trying a different approach with the calculator, but I still repeat chunks of code. That's not right, it has to be simplyfiable, but I don't know how yet.
### EDIT
I think I figured it out. I feel super smart, this is what it's all about! I still have things to improve, but it feels awesome!
## 30-AUG-21
I'm brainstorming some soluitions to a problem I have with the calculator. It may save some lines and reduce complexity by one while-do loop, but the conditions seems far too complex. Though now I can't come up with any elegant solution like yesterday. That was some big brain stuff, I'm still proud of it. Saving a hundert and potetially a few huderts more lines of code by writing methods with hard coded parameters for different uses. It feels great thinking about it, I wish I had code literrate friends so I could boast about it heh.
